    <p class="about-text">I'm Connor Owen, a D1 soccer player at Columbia University and former Quakes Academy player. I created the ScanBand to solve a problem I’ve seen at every level of the game: players aren’t scanning enough—and there’s never been a good way to teach it. I was fortunate to have coaches who emphasized scanning early on, but even then, it relied on constant yelling and didn’t always stick. The ScanBand changes that. It acts like a personal coach on your head, gently reminding you to scan until it becomes instinct. Simple. Effective. Game-changing.</p>
