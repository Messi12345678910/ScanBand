        <p class="about-text">I'm Connor Owen—D1 soccer player at Columbia and former San Jose Earthquakes Academy player.
          <br>
          From club to college, I've seen it everywhere:
          players don't scan enough, and coaches don't have a reliable way to teach it.
          <br>
          I was lucky. My coaches emphasized scanning early on—
          but it still took constant yelling, and the habit didn't always stick.
          <br>
          That's why I created ScanBand:
          a coach on your head that quietly reminds you to scan—
          until it becomes instinct.
          <br>
          Simple. Effective. Game-changing.
